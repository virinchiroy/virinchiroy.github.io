Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University (NYU), advised by Prof. Farshad Khorrami at the Control/Robotics Research Laboratory (CRRL). My interests lie in the fields of robotics, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Before joining NYU, I completed my undergraduate studies from Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2018.
