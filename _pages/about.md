I am a PhD candidate at New York University in the department of ECE, advised by Prof. Farshad Khorrami.

My interests are in the intersection of robotics and cybersecurity.

I completed my undergraduate from Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2018.
